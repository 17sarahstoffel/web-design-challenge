This is my solution to homework 11 for the data bootcamp


# Overview
In this project I was taking past data and visualizations about 500+ cities's weather trends and their latitudes. I took this data and made a website to display my findings. Using html coding and bootstrap to assist with the formating I was able to create a home pages, four visualization pages, a data page, and a comparsion page. There is a navigation bar that will allow visters of the cite to click on the certain page they want to go to. From there, I used Git Pages to create a website page.
